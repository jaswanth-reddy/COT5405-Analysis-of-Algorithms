1. Survey Paper on FFT:

Abstract:

Fast Fourier Transform is a computationally efficient algorithm[5] used to compute the “Discrete Fourier Transform” values of a sequence by Matrix Multiplication using Divide and Conquer Paradigm approach. This survey paper elaborates in detail about the underlying algorithms used to achieve it making it to reduce the Asymptotic analysis from 𝑂(𝑛!) to 𝑂(𝑛 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛). We further understand the nuances involved in the scenarios for FFT like : FFT2, D&C approaches, De-noising, etc.


2. Programming Project:

Abstract:

Getting started, this project entails about in-depth understanding & nuances involved in the implementation of efficient design strategies for solving possible real-world situations. The problem statement describes that, due to the recent advancements and scope towards colonization on mars, several metrics regarding the climatic conditions are being taken into consideration for Human survival on Mars. Some factors are listed below:
• Air Quality Index M[i, j] is a rating or metric used to determine the quality of air, to select building new home, for all (i, j) represents the location on the designated space. Values assigned can be either Positive/ Negative
• Provided a suitable Rectangular Area.
• Total Air Quality Index is summation of all included indices in the rectangular area.
    
Problem Statements:

1. Design an Algorithm subject to the condition of obtaining the Maximum sum of the Air Quality Index in the Contiguous subarray locations.
2. Design an Algorithm subject to a similar condition as above with an additional criterion of finding the Maximum sum of the Air Quality Index in 2-Dimensional Array of size m x n.
